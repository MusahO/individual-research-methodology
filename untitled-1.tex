\section{INTRODUCTION}\label{sec:intro}

Crime is defined as “An action or an instance of negligence that is injurious to the public welfare or morals or to the interests of the state and that is legally prohibited”


 In the sociological field, crime is the breach of a rule or law for which some which some governing authority or force may ultimately prescribe a punishment. The word crime is derived from the Latin word Crimen

\section{BACKGROUND} 
I have chosen this topic because of increasing crime rate in the city suburbs during the last decade. We have to study the causes and factors behind this critical issue and also give some suggestions and recommendations to overcome this problem.

\section{OBJECTIVES}
1)	To use big data and machine learning to try when and where crime will take place by analyzing existing data on past crimes.


\section{LIMITATIONS}
As I am a student, I don’t have sufficient amount of money to fulfill this task accurately and precisely. Being a student, I have to face the time managing problem; I have no sufficient time due to other subjects and practical work to be done.
